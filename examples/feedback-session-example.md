## Actionable Feedback

### FB-001: Button tap targets too small on mobile
- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** UX Issue
- **Timestamp:** 00:14
- **Signals:** mobile, tap target, button, touch

#### What Happened

> Okay so I'm looking at the dashboard on a 375 viewport and these action buttons in the header are way too small.
> Like the "Export" and "Filter" buttons — I keep missing them on tap.
> They're maybe 28px tall which is below the 44px minimum for touch targets.
> This is gonna frustrate anyone on a phone.

### FB-002: Layout shift after loading spinner
- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Performance
- **Timestamp:** 00:58

#### What Happened

> There's a janky layout shift happening when the data loads in.
> Watch — the spinner is centered in the card, but when the table renders it pushes everything down by like 40 pixels.
> The sidebar jumps too because the main content height changes.
> We need a skeleton or a min-height on that container so the layout doesn't reflow.

#### Evidence

#### Suggested Next Step
- Profile this flow, target the slow step first, and validate before/after metrics for: "There's a janky layout shift happening when the data loads in. Watch — the spinner is centered in the card, but when the table r...".

### FB-003: Nav highlight not updating on route change
- **Severity:** High
- **Type:** Bug
- **Timestamp:** 01:41

#### What Happened

> Alright this one's a bug.
> I click "Analytics" in the sidebar and the page changes but the active highlight is still on "Overview."
> If I click away and come back it fixes itself, so the state is updating but the CSS class isn't rerendering.
> Probably a missing dependency in a useEffect or the router isn't triggering a rerender on the nav component.

#### Evidence
![FB-003-1](screenshots/fb-003-1.png)

![FB-003-2](screenshots/fb-003-2.png)

#### Suggested Next Step
- Reproduce and patch this defect, then add a regression test that validates: "Alright this one's a bug. I click "Analytics" in the sidebar and the page changes but the active highlight is still on "Over...".

### FB-004: Table doesn't scroll horizontally on narrow viewports
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Type:** UX Issue
- **Timestamp:** 02:35

#### What Happened

> The data table on the metrics page — on anything under maybe 768px it just overflows off screen.
> You can't scroll it horizontally, the last two columns are just clipped.
> Needs an overflow-x auto on the table wrapper.
> This is probably a one-line fix but it makes the whole page unusable on tablet.

#### Evidence

#### Suggested Next Step
- Revise the UI interaction and run a quick usability check focused on: "The data table on the metrics page — on anything under maybe 768px it just overflows off screen. You can't scroll it horizon...".
