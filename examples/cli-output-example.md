## Transcript

### [0:00] Looking at the auth middleware
> Okay so I'm reviewing the auth middleware and the first thing I notice is there's no rate limiting on the login endpoint.
> Someone could brute-force passwords all day and we wouldn't throttle them.

### [0:34] The JWT expiry is set to 30 days
> The JWT expiry here is set to 30 days which is way too long.
> If a token gets leaked that's a month-long window.
> Should be more like 15 minutes for access tokens with a refresh token flow.

### [1:02] No CSRF protection on the form
> This form submission handler doesn't have any CSRF protection.
> There's no token validation, no SameSite cookie attribute check — nothing.
> Anyone could craft a cross-site request and it would go through.

### [1:45] Error messages leak internal details
> These error responses are leaking internal details.
> Like here — a failed login returns the full Prisma error with the query and table name.
> That's giving attackers a map of our database schema.
> We need generic error messages for the client and structured logging server-side.

### [2:22] The password reset flow has no expiry
> Last thing — the password reset tokens don't expire.
> Once you generate a reset link it's valid forever.
> Should be 15 minutes max, and single-use.
