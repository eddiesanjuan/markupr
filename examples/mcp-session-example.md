## Transcript

### [0:00] Grid layout breaks at the md breakpoint
> So I've got this product grid that's supposed to go from single column on mobile to three columns at the md breakpoint.
> But look at this — at exactly 768px it's doing this weird thing where the third item wraps to a new row with a huge gap.

### [0:38] The gap property is conflicting with the padding
> I think the issue is the gap combined with the container padding.
> The grid is set to gap-6 which is 24px, and the container has px-4 on each side, so the math doesn't work out for three equal columns.
> The total width exceeds the container and the last item wraps.

### [1:18] Same issue on the category filter bar
> Actually wait, the same thing is happening on the category filter bar up top.
> These pill buttons are in a flex-wrap container and at that same breakpoint two of them drop to a second line when they shouldn't.
> Probably the same root cause — padding plus gap not accounting for the container boundaries.
