# Changelog

All notable changes to markupR will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.6] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate renderer `ThemeProvider` nesting that could apply conflicting theme variables and cause low-contrast/dark text in BYOK settings under dark mode.
- Fixed BYOK key readiness sync in Settings > Advanced by recalculating both OpenAI and Anthropic key presence after each successful key save.
- Fixed main capture card readiness state so successful OpenAI key setup is reflected immediately instead of getting stuck on `Add OpenAI Key`.

## [2.6.5] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Added cue-time capture context snapshots for marked screenshots:
  - cursor position
  - active window/app hints
  - focused element hints (renderer DOM + macOS accessibility best-effort)
- Added context-aware frame/report enrichment:
  - extracted frames can carry nearest capture context metadata
  - markdown and template outputs now include context hints when available
  - JSON template now includes `captureContext` per frame
- Added MCP context metadata capture and persistence:
  - `capture_screenshot` now stores cursor/app/focus hints in session metadata
  - recording tools persist start/stop context snapshots

### Changed
- Expanded session metadata schemas (desktop + MCP) to include capture context history.
- Manual screenshot IPC now accepts optional focused-element context from renderer.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- Added Anthropic API key setup directly into onboarding (OpenAI step followed by Anthropic step).
- Fixed stale BYOK/transcription readiness state after saving keys by broadcasting and listening for `markupr:settings-updated` events.
- Fixed renderer crash risk when `window.markupr.processing` is unavailable by guarding progress subscriptions.
- Improved Settings panel contrast in dark mode by replacing hardcoded dark colors with theme tokens.
- Cleaned landing page premium section copy to remove internal launch-plan phrasing.

### Changed
- Standardized user-facing branding text to `markupR` across updated onboarding/settings/landing surfaces.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-14

### Security
- Removed `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` XSS vector from UpdateNotification (React component rendering)
- Enabled `sandbox: true` on all BrowserWindow instances
- Added IPC input validation across all handler files (type checks, range checks, whitelists)
- Added prototype pollution prevention on settings import
- Added API key service whitelist (openai, anthropic only)
- Added path containment checks on session deletion and folder opening
- Added Whisper model name whitelist
- Restricted child process environment variables (no API key leakage)
- Added `window.open` protocol validation (https/http only)
- Tightened CSP with explicit `connect-src`, `img-src`, `media-src`, `frame-ancestors`
- Set `chmod 0600` on temp audio files and plaintext API key fallback

### Robustness
- Added double-start race condition guard on recording toggle
- Fixed watchdog timer to only run during active sessions (saves 86,400 CPU wake-ups/day)
- Added `isDestroyed()` checks on all BrowserWindow access (12 instances)
- Added `safeSendToRenderer()` helper for crash-safe IPC sends
- Added 200MB audio memory cap to prevent OOM on long sessions
- Added synchronous crash logging for reliable persistence

- Added error boundaries on all IPC session handlers
- Added write chain error resilience in capture handlers
- Fixed `forceRecovery` re-entry guard
- Fixed session state consistency after forced transitions
- Added recovery buffer cleanup on normal app quit

### CLI
- Added proper signal handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM kill child processes, clean up temp files)
- Added video file validation (exists, is file, non-empty, contains video stream via ffprobe)
- Added ffmpeg availability check at startup with platform-specific install hints
- Added temp file cleanup in `finally` block (no more leaked WAV files)
- Added machine-parseable `OUTPUT:` prefix line for AI agent consumption
- Added meaningful exit codes (0=success, 1=user error, 2=system error)
- Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var support (primary) with CLI flag as override with security warning
- Added progress indicators visible in non-verbose mode

### Output Quality
- Fixed timestamp unit mismatch in AI-enhanced documents (seconds vs milliseconds)
- Restored FB-XXX IDs in AI-enhanced markdown (consistent with free tier)
- Fixed `wrapTranscription` malformed blockquotes for 2-sentence transcripts
- Fixed PDF export for image-heavy sessions (temp file approach vs data: URL limit)
- Added buffer-to-base64 fallback in HTML export for missing screenshot data
- Added short-circuit for Claude API on empty sessions (saves API calls)
- Fixed `inferCategory` over-matching ("address" no longer matches "add")
- Added deterministic date formatting (consistent across platforms)
- Added rich metadata to markdown output (segment count, frame count, duration, platform)
- Improved error messages across the codebase (actionable guidance, no stack trace leaks)

### Accessibility (Landing Page)
- Added skip-to-content link
- Added `<main>` landmark element
- Added focus trap on donate modal with focus return
- Fixed ARIA radiogroup pattern (role="radio" + aria-checked)
- Added screen reader text for external links
- Added focus-visible styles with amber outline
- Fixed color contrast ratios (dark mode tertiary, light mode tertiary, light mode accent)
- Fixed donate modal light mode (text was invisible on dark background)
- Added noscript fallback for scroll-reveal content

### Platform Compatibility
- Added Windows environment variables (USERPROFILE, TEMP) to child process environments
- Fixed WhisperService models directory fallback (os.homedir() instead of /tmp)
- Made tooltip shortcuts platform-aware (Cmd on macOS, Ctrl on Windows/Linux)
- Made permission error messages reference correct OS settings panels
- Added platform-specific ffmpeg install hints (brew/winget/apt/dnf)

### Documentation

- Added "Why markupR?" positioning section to README
- Fixed AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md critical broken commands
- Fixed stale version references across docs and templates
- Removed documented-but-unimplemented --openai-key flag from README

### Testing
- Added 126 new tests across 5 new test files (389 to 515 total)
  - CrashRecovery (31 tests): serialization, crash detection, log sanitization, session detection
  - ErrorHandler (31 tests): categorization, rotation, buffering, rate limiting
  - MarkdownGenerator (21 tests): output format, heading structure, input combinations
