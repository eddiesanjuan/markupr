## First-Time Setup

When you launch markupR for the first time, the onboarding wizard will guide you through:

1. **Welcome** - Introduction to markupR
2. **Permissions** - Granting required system permissions
3. **BYOK Keys (Optional)** - Configuring OpenAI + Anthropic keys for full AI-assisted reports
4. **Quick Tour** - Learning the basic workflow

You can skip the wizard and configure settings manually, but we recommend completing it.

## Configuring BYOK API Keys (Optional)

markupR can run local-first, and you can optionally configure BYOK keys for full cloud-assisted transcription + analysis.

### Which keys do I need?

- **OpenAI key**: used for BYOK transcription workflows
- **Anthropic key**: used for BYOK AI analysis workflows

If you only want capture + basic local workflows, you can start without keys and add them later.

### Create your keys

1. OpenAI: [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Anthropic: [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
3. Create keys and copy them immediately (you may not be able to view them again).

### Add keys in markupR

1. Open markupR
2. Go to **Settings** (`Cmd+,` on macOS, `Ctrl+,` on Windows)
3. Navigate to **Advanced**
4. Paste your OpenAI and Anthropic keys in their respective fields
5. Click **Test Connection** for each key
6. Confirm each shows **API key verified and saved securely**

## Granting Permissions

markupR requires certain system permissions to function properly.

### macOS Permissions

#### Microphone Access

markupR needs microphone access to capture your voice narration.

1. When prompted, click **OK** to allow microphone access
2. If you denied access, go to:
   - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone

#### Screen Recording

markupR needs screen recording permission to capture screenshots.

1. When prompted, click **Open System Preferences**
2. Go to Security & Privacy > Privacy > Screen Recording

### Windows Permissions

Windows typically handles permissions automatically. If you encounter issues:

1. Right-click on markupR in the Start menu
2. Select "Run as administrator" (for first run only)
3. Follow any Windows Security prompts

### Linux Permissions

Depending on your distribution, you may need to:

```bash

sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER

# Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
```
