## Screenshot Issues

### Black Screenshots

**Symptom**: All screenshots are solid black

**Causes**:
- Screen recording permission not granted
- DRM-protected content (Netflix, etc.)
- GPU/driver issues

### Wrong Monitor Captured

**Symptom**: Screenshots from different monitor than selected

**Solutions**:
1. Use Window Selector carefully
2. Select specific window instead of full screen
3. Check display arrangement in system settings

### Screenshots Not Capturing

**Symptom**: Screenshot count stays at 0

**Causes**:
- Voice pause threshold too high
- Not pausing long enough
- Audio issues (no voice detected)

**Solutions**:
1. Lower pause threshold: Settings > Recording > Pause Threshold
2. Pause more deliberately while speaking
3. Use manual screenshot: `Cmd+Shift+S` / `Ctrl+Shift+S`
4. Check audio is being captured (waveform active)

### Screenshots Too Frequent

**Symptom**: Too many screenshots, capturing on every pause

**Solutions**:
1. Increase pause threshold: Settings > Recording
2. Increase minimum time between captures
3. Speak more continuously

## Hotkey Issues

### Hotkey Not Working

**Symptoms**: Pressing hotkey does nothing

**Checklist**:
1. **Check permissions** (macOS Accessibility)
2. **Check for conflicts**:
   - Another app using same hotkey
   - System shortcut conflict
3. **Try different hotkey**: Settings > Hotkeys
4. **Restart FeedbackFlow**

### Hotkey Works in Some Apps Only

**Causes**:
- App captures keystrokes before system (games, VMs)
- App has same hotkey defined

**Solutions**:
1. Change FeedbackFlow hotkey
2. Check app's shortcut settings
3. Exit full-screen mode

### Hotkey Works but Takes Long

1. **Check disk space**: Ensure enough space for export
2. **Check write permissions**: Can you write to output folder?
3. **Check path**: Avoid special characters in path

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure session has screenshots
2. Try with "Include Images" disabled
3. Try smaller session (fewer items)

### Corrupted Export

**Symptom**: File opens but content is garbled

**Solutions**:
1. Re-export with different settings
2. Try different format
3. Check for disk errors

## Performance Issues

### High CPU Usage

**Solutions**:
1. Close other applications
2. Disable audio waveform: Settings > Recording
3. Increase pause threshold (fewer screenshots)
4. Restart FeedbackFlow periodically

### High Memory Usage

**Symptom**: Memory usage grows during long sessions

**Solutions**:
1. Keep sessions under 10 minutes
2. Restart FeedbackFlow between sessions
3. Close other memory-intensive apps

### Slow Export
