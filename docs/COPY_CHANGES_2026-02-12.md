# markupr Landing Page Copy Changes

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**File:** `site/index.html`
**Branch:** `copy/new-positioning`
**Positioning shift:** "Documentation tool" --> "Feedback loop accelerator"
**New tagline:** "You see it. You say it. Your AI fixes it."

## Summary

These changes reposition markupr from a screen-recording documentation tool to a feedback-loop closer for AI coding agents. The old copy emphasized "writing things up" and "generating reports." The new copy frames markupr as the bridge between what a developer sees on screen and what their AI agent needs to fix it. The word "report" is replaced by "structured context" throughout. Every call to action now points toward a concrete outcome: the AI fixes the bug.

## Changes (15 total)

### 1. Page Title

**Before:** `markupR -- App feedback, made effortless`
**After:** `markupR -- You see it. You say it. Your AI fixes it.`

*Rationale: Old title was generic SaaS. New title is the campaign tagline -- specific, memorable, and describes the full loop in one sentence.*

---

### 2. Meta Description

**Before:** `markupR records your screen while you talk, then assembles structured Markdown with the right screenshots at the right moments. Launch includes both BYOK open source mode and touchless premium mode with hosted keys.`
**After:** `markupR closes the feedback loop between what you see on screen and what your AI coding agent fixes. Record your screen, say what's wrong, and get structured Markdown your agent can act on immediately.`

*Rationale: Old description led with mechanics. New description leads with the value proposition and outcome. Also removes launch-specific language ("Launch includes") that will age poorly.*

---

### 3. Hero Headline (H1)

**Before:** `You found the bug. markupR writes it up.`
**After:** `You see it. You say it. Your AI fixes it.`

*Rationale: Old headline positioned markupr as a writing tool. New headline positions it as a feedback loop that ends with a fix. Three short declarative sentences with parallel structure.*

---

### 4. Hero Subtext

**Before:** `AI writes your code. You still have to review it. markupR records your screen while you talk through what you see, then assembles a structured Markdown document your AI agent can act on immediately.`
**After:** `You know exactly what's wrong. You just can't describe it precisely enough for the AI to fix it. markupR records your screen while you talk, then gives your coding agent the structured context it needs to act.`

*Rationale: Old subtext started with a statement about AI writing code (not about markupr). New subtext names the specific pain point -- the articulation gap -- and positions markupr as the solution.*

---

### 5. Quick Walkthrough Description

**Before:** `You record and mark shots. After you stop, markupR runs AI alignment on narration + frames and generates a clean report your agent can use.`
**After:** `You record and mark shots. After you stop, markupR aligns narration with frames and closes the loop -- your agent gets structured context to start fixing.`

*Rationale: Replaced "generates a clean report" with "closes the loop." Replaced jargon ("AI alignment on narration + frames") with plain language. Ends with action ("start fixing") not possession ("can use").*

---

### 6. Walkthrough Output Label

**Before:** `Output: AI-readable markdown ready to paste into GitHub, Linear, Slack, or your coding agent.`
**After:** `Output: Structured markdown your coding agent acts on. Also works in GitHub, Linear, and Slack.`

*Rationale: Old copy listed the agent last, as one of four equal destinations. New copy leads with the primary use case (feed your agent) and demotes other destinations to a secondary clause.*

---

### 7. How It Works Section Heading

**Before:** `Three steps from bug to AI-ready report.`
**After:** `Three steps from bug to AI fix.`

*Rationale: The end goal is a fix, not a report. Shorter, punchier.*

---

### 8. Step 3 Label (How It Works)

**Before:** `Share Report`
**After:** `Feed Your Agent`

*Rationale: "Share Report" is passive and generic. "Feed Your Agent" is specific to the new positioning and implies the agent takes action after receiving the output.*

---

### 9. Step 3 Description (How It Works)

**Before:** `Open the markdown report and paste it into your tools or AI agent.`
**After:** `Paste the markdown into your AI coding agent. It has everything it needs to fix what you described.`

*Rationale: Old copy was vague ("your tools or AI agent"). New copy is specific about the destination (AI coding agent) and makes a confidence claim about completeness.*

---

### 10. "Stop retyping" Card -- Final Sentence

**Before:** `markupR lets you just say it. The documentation happens behind you.`
**After:** `markupR lets you just say it. Your agent gets what it needs to fix it.`

*Rationale: "The documentation happens behind you" sounds like the goal is documentation. New copy redirects the outcome to the agent getting what it needs for a fix.*

---

### 11. "150 wpm" Card -- Body Text

**Before:** `A five-minute narration produces more structured output than twenty minutes of writing. And the result is better -- markupR places screenshots at the exact moments you were describing something, not wherever you remembered to paste them.`
**After:** `A five-minute narration gives your AI agent more precise context than twenty minutes of writing. markupR places screenshots at the exact moments you were describing something -- so the agent sees what you saw, when you saw it.`

*Rationale: Old copy compared output quantity. New copy frames the comparison around agent context quality. Final clause ("the agent sees what you saw") reinforces the feedback-loop metaphor.*

---

### 12. Features List -- Structured Markdown Output

**Before:** `Sections, headings, and images assembled into a document your tools already understand. Paste into GitHub, feed to Claude Code, drop into Slack.`
**After:** `Sections, headings, and screenshots assembled into context your AI agent already understands. Feed to Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot -- or paste into GitHub and Slack.`

*Rationale: "images" --> "screenshots" (more specific). "document" --> "context" (positioning shift). Added Cursor and Copilot as named agent destinations. Reordered to lead with agents, not GitHub.*

---

### 13. Code Block Title (Example Output)

**Before:** `session-output.md`
**After:** `feedback-session.md`

*Rationale: "session-output" sounds like a system artifact. "feedback-session" sounds like something a human initiated with intent. Subtle but aligns with positioning.*

---

### 14. CLI Section -- Second Paragraph

**Before:** `The CLI runs the full markupr post-processing pipeline: transcription, frame extraction, and markdown generation. Point it at a video file and get the same AI-ready output.`
**After:** `The CLI runs the full markupr pipeline: transcription, frame extraction, and markdown generation. Point it at a video file and get structured context your agent can act on.`

*Rationale: Dropped "post-processing" (unnecessary jargon). Replaced "AI-ready output" with "structured context your agent can act on" (consistent language with rest of page).*

---

### 15. Pricing Section -- Heading and Description

**Before:**
- Heading: `Same markupr output. Two ways to run it.`
- Body: `markupr open source and markupr premium run the same core pipeline: record screen + narration, transcribe, extract the right frames, and generate agent-ready markdown. Premium is the touchless path with hosted keys preconfigured. BYOK stays fully supported.`

**After:**
- Heading: `Same feedback loop. Two ways to run it.`
- Body: `Both modes close the same feedback loop: record what you see, say what's wrong, and hand your AI agent structured context to fix it. Premium hosts the API keys for you. BYOK gives you full control.`

*Rationale: Old heading led with "output" (product-centric). New heading leads with "feedback loop" (outcome-centric). Body is rewritten to be shorter, clearer, and consistent with the new positioning. "BYOK stays fully supported" --> "BYOK gives you full control" (more empowering).*

## What Was NOT Changed

The following copy was reviewed and deliberately preserved:

- **Navigation links** -- "How it works", "Features", "Pricing", "Star on GitHub" (structural, not positioning-dependent)
- **"Record" and "Mark shots" step labels** (steps 1 and 2 in How It Works) -- already action-oriented
- **"Stop retyping" and "150 wpm" card headlines** -- already strong, pain-point-driven
- **Feature list items** other than Structured Markdown Output (already accurate and specific)
- **Pricing tier names, prices, and feature bullets** -- factual, not positioning copy
- **Footer content** -- legal, links, copyright
- **Demo video section** -- no text copy to change
- **Open source / MIT license messaging** -- factual, important for trust
- **Download button labels and platform detection logic** -- functional UI, not marketing copy
- **Onboarding-related copy** ("No account needed", permission prompts) -- UX copy, separate concern
- **"Quick visual walkthrough" overline** -- still accurate
