## r/ClaudeAI Post

**Title:** markupr v2.5.0: now pushes feedback directly to GitHub Issues and Linear

**Body:**

Hey r/ClaudeAI -- sharing an update on markupr, the open-source tool that captures developer feedback as structured Markdown for AI coding agents.

**What markupr does:** You record your screen while narrating what you see. markupr transcribes with Whisper, detects key moments, extracts the exact video frames, and generates structured Markdown with screenshots placed where they belong. The output is built for AI agents -- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.

**What's new in v2.5.0:** The feedback loop is now closed. markupr doesn't just capture anymore -- it delivers.

- **Output templates** -- 5 built-in formats: markdown, json, github-issue, linear, jira. Same recording, different output depending on where it's going.
- **Watch mode** -- `markupr watch ./dir` auto-processes new recordings as they appear. Drop a file, get structured output.
- **Push to GitHub Issues** -- `markupr push github --repo owner/repo` creates a structured GitHub issue with uploaded screenshots and auto-applied labels.
- **Push to Linear** -- `markupr push linear --team KEY` creates a prioritized Linear issue with inferred priority and labels.
- **GitHub Action** -- `eddiesanjuan/markupr-action@v1` runs the pipeline in CI/CD and posts visual feedback as PR comments.

**The angle:** v2.4.0 gave your AI agent eyes and ears (MCP server with 6 tools). v2.5.0 gives it hands -- feedback flows from screen to issue tracker without you touching a thing.

860 tests. MIT licensed. All local-first. No telemetry.

## r/cursor Post

**Title:** markupr v2.5.0: screen recording to GitHub Issues/Linear in one command (MCP + CLI + GitHub Action)

**Body:**

Update on markupr for the Cursor community. If you haven't seen it: markupr records your screen + voice, transcribes with Whisper, extracts frames at the right moments, and generates structured Markdown. Works as an MCP server, CLI tool, or desktop app.

**v2.5.0 just shipped with 5 features that close the feedback loop:**

1. **Output templates** -- `--template github-issue` formats output specifically for GitHub Issues. Also: json, linear, jira, markdown.
2. **Watch mode** -- `markupr watch ./recordings` processes new files automatically as they appear.
3. **Push to GitHub** -- `markupr push github --repo owner/repo` creates an issue with screenshots uploaded and embedded.
4. **Push to Linear** -- `markupr push linear --team ENG` creates a prioritized ticket.
5. **GitHub Action** -- add `eddiesanjuan/markupr-action@v1` to your workflows for visual feedback on PRs.

**For Cursor users specifically:** Add markupr as an MCP server (3 lines of config) and your agent can capture screenshots and record your screen mid-conversation. Combine with the new push commands and your agent can file bugs it finds directly into your issue tracker.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "markupr": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "--package", "markupr", "markupr-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

860 tests. MIT. Open source. All processing runs locally.
