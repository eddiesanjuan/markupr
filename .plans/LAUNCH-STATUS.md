## What Eddie Needs To Do Today

### Blocking (do first -- everything else depends on these)
- [ ] Record 90s desktop workflow demo video (hotkey -> narrate -> markdown -> paste into Claude Code -> agent fixes bug)
- [ ] Record 60s MCP + Claude Code demo video (Claude Code calling `capture_screenshot` and fixing a bug)
- [ ] Create GIFs from demo videos (800px wide, first 15s for hero GIF)
- [ ] Export 400x400 PNG logo for Cline Marketplace (from `src/renderer/assets/logo.svg`)
- [ ] Add demo GIF to top of README (replace placeholder)

### Publishing (can start after demos are done)
- [ ] Publish blog post on Hashnode (copy from `.plans/launch-blog-post-hashnode.md`)
- [ ] Cross-post to Dev.to (copy from `.plans/launch-blog-post-devto.md`, add `canonical_url` pointing to Hashnode post)
- [ ] Submit to MCP directories (follow `.plans/mcp-submissions.md` -- 11 directories, sections a-k)
- [ ] Post first social content -- Twitter/X launch thread (follow `.plans/launch-content.md` section 4)

### Optional Today
- [ ] Create Twitter/X header card (1200x675)
- [ ] Enable GitHub Discussions (categories: General, Ideas, Show & Tell, Q&A)

## Notes for Agents

- The `.plans/` files are copy-paste ready. Open the file, select the relevant section, paste into the platform.
- Blog post frontmatter is included -- just paste the whole file into Hashnode/Dev.to editor.
- MCP submissions each have their own section (a through k) with pre-written descriptions tailored to each directory's format.
- The launch-content.md file is organized by platform with section numbers (1=HN, 2=PH, 3=Reddit, 4=Twitter, 5=LinkedIn).
- `markupr-mcp` does NOT exist as a separate npm package. The MCP server is accessed via `npx markupr-mcp` which is a bin entry in the main `markupr` package.
